# SIGMArec

**Automatically record your gameplay with OBS Studio and pixel-based game state detection.**

---

## What it does

- Records automatically whenever you play a song.
- Stops recording after the song ends and renames the file to `lastplay`.
- Press your configured key on the result screen to save the replay with a timestamped filename.

---

## Supported Games

- beatmania IIDX INFINITAS
- Sound Voltex Exceed Gear Konasute (I hope, need confirmation the pixels are correct)
- beatmania IIDX 32 Pinky Crush
- Sound Voltex Exceed Gear
- *literally any game you want to add pixels for*

*More games will be supported out of the box over time..*

## Security & Antivirus Warning

Because SIGMArec:

- Runs with administrator privileges (to detect keypresses reliably).   
- Periodically takes screenshots of your screen to detect game states.

**Windows Defender or other antivirus software may flag or block the program as suspicious or potentially harmful.**

These behaviors are common in malware but harmless in SIGMArec, hence the false positive detection.

If this happens you can either:

- Add an exclusion in Windows Defender for the SIGMArec executable.
- Use the python script directly rather than the window binary.

## Setup & Usage

### 1. Requirements

### Windows (binary)

Simply grab the latest tagged [release](https://github.com/NotAkitake/SIGMArec/releases/) archive and extract it!

### Manual

- Latest Python and pip installed  
- Clone the project
- Run in project folder:  
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

### 2. Configure

If you're unsure about certain values, default are usually fine.

- Rename `example.config.json` â†’ `config.json`  
- Edit `config.json`:  
  - Set `"key_save_play"` to the keyboard key you want to use for saving replays (e.g., `"k"`).  
  - Set `"video_subfolders"` to `true` to organize videos into per-game folders, or `false` to save all in one place.  
  - Set `"result_wait_time"` to how long to keep recording after detecting the result screen (in seconds).  
  - Set `"detection_interval"` to how often frames are checked for state changes (in seconds).  
  - Set `"detection_frames"` to how many consecutive frames must agree on a state before it is accepted (helps prevent false positives).  
  - Set `"pixel_tolerance"` to the maximum allowed difference between expected and actual RGB values.  
    For example, with a tolerance of `5`, a red value of `245` would match anything from `240` to `250`.  
    Useful for handling small visual variations, but shouldn't be needed in most cases.  
  - Add paths to your custom `.wav` sound files (optional).  
  - Fill in your OBS WebSocket connection details: `"host"`, `"port"`, and `"password"`.  

- **No need to modify pixel groups unless you're adding support for new games.**

### 3. Run

- Start OBS, enable WebSocket server (`Tools > WebSocket Server Settings`)  
- Copy your WebSocket password and paste it in `config.json`  
- Run `sigmarec.exe` or python script:  
  ```bash
  python sigmarec.py
  ```  
  *(Will restart as admin to detect keys when the game is focused)*  
- Play your game! If it's supported recordings will start/stop automatically.  
- On the result screen, press your save key to keep your replay.  
**You need to hold the key a bit longer than you might imagine, as checks happen every half a second by default.**

## Adding or tweaking games

Each game config includes:

- List of possible process names (executables)  
- Partial window title to confirm game is active  
- Short game name used to name saved video files
- Pixel groups for detecting states (Select, Playing, Result)

You can add your own games by following the format in `example.config.json`.

---

## Notes

- Increasing `check_interval` reduces CPU usage but slows detection.  
- OBS WebSocket password resets on OBS restart unless manually set or disabled (not recommended).
